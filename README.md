## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Linux** (tested on Arch Linux)
- **C++20** compiler (GCC 7+ or Clang 6+) [since protobufs only support C++ 20+]
- **CMake** 3.16+
- **Protocol Buffers** compiler (v3.0.0+, tested with v32.0.0)
- **Prometheus-CPP** library for metrics
- **Abseil** library for logging and utilities
- **ZLIB** for compression
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for containerized deployment - optional)

**Note**: Redis dependencies are optional and disabled by default. The system can run without Redis.

### Installation

#### Option 1: Native Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**

   **Ubuntu/Debian:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake pkg-config \
       libssl-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler \
       libfmt-dev libasio-dev
   ```

   **Arch Linux:**

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake pkg-config \
        protobuf zlib abseil-cpp
   
   # Install Prometheus-CPP
   yay -S prometheus-cpp-git
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Distributed-File-Grid
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DWITH_REDIS=OFF ..
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

   This will create four executables:
   - `head_server` - Main file operations server with Redis integration
   - `cluster_server` - Chunk storage server with Prometheus metrics
   - `health_checker` - Traditional heartbeat-based monitoring service
   - `zk_head_server_monitor` - **NEW** ZooKeeper-based head server coordination

3. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start_services.sh
   ```

#### Option 2: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Quick Start with Testing**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Distributed-File-Grid
   
   # Run comprehensive test suite
   chmod +x docker-test.sh
   ./docker-test.sh
   ```

2. **Production Deployment**

   ```bash
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Check service status
   docker-compose ps
   
   # View logs
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

3. **Access Web Interfaces**
   - **Grafana Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
   - **Prometheus Metrics**: http://localhost:9090
   - **Head Server 1**: http://localhost:9669
   - **Head Server 2**: http://localhost:9670

4. **ZooKeeper Management**
   ```bash
   # Interactive ZooKeeper monitor
   docker-compose exec zk-head-monitor /usr/local/bin/zk_head_server_monitor -i
   
   # Commands: register, status, leader, quit
   ```

---

## Usage

### File Operations

The system provides a RESTful API for file operations:

```bash
# Upload a file
curl -X POST http://localhost:9669/upload \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.txt"

# Download a file
curl -X GET http://localhost:9669/download/filename.txt \
  -o downloaded_file.txt

# List files
curl -X GET http://localhost:9669/files

# Delete a file
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9669/files/filename.txt
```

### Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory:

- `head_server_config.json` - Head server settings
- `health_checker_config.json` - Health checker settings

Key configuration options:

```json
{
  "replication_factor": 3, // Number of chunk replicas
  "chunk_size": 67108864, // 64MB chunks
  "heartbeat_timeout": 60, // Health check interval (seconds)
  "max_connections": 1000 // Maximum concurrent connections
}
```

### Monitoring & Management

# Available commands:
register head_server_3 192.168.1.100 9671  # Register new head server
status                                       # Show health status
leader                                       # Show current leader
quit                                         # Exit
```

#### Health Check Endpoints
```bash
# Service health checks
curl http://localhost:9669/health    # Head server (if implemented)
curl http://localhost:9091/metrics   # Cluster server metrics
curl http://localhost:9090/targets   # Prometheus targets
```

## Architecture Details

### File Storage Process

1. **Upload**:
   - File received by head server
   - Split into 64MB chunks
   - Chunks distributed to cluster servers based on available storage
   - Replication factor enforced across servers

2. **Download**:
   - Head server retrieves file metadata
   - Chunks fetched from cluster servers
   - File reconstructed and served to client
   - Integrity verified using stored hashes

3. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Heartbeat signals sent every 30 seconds
   - Resource usage reported (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Failed servers detected automatically
   - Re-replication triggered for failed chunks

### Fault Tolerance

- **Replication**: Each chunk stored on multiple servers
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of all servers
- **Auto-Recovery**: Failed chunks automatically re-replicated
- **Leader Election**: Health checker coordinates failover
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced capacity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Won't Start**
   - Check if ports are available (9669, 8080-8082, 6379)
   - Check logs in `logs/` directory

2. **High Resource Usage**
   - Adjust `replication_factor` in configuration
   - Add more cluster servers
   - Monitor with dashboard at http://localhost:3000

3. **File Upload Failures**
   - Verify cluster servers are healthy
   - Check available storage on cluster servers
   - Review head server logs

### Logs and Debugging

#### Native Deployment
- **Head Server**: `logs/head_server.log`
- **Cluster Servers**: `logs/cluster_server_*.log`
- **Health Checker**: `logs/health_checker.log`
- **ZooKeeper Monitor**: `logs/zk_monitor.log`

#### Docker Deployment
```bash
# View all service logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs -f head-server-1
docker-compose logs -f zk-head-monitor

# Real-time log monitoring
docker-compose logs -f --tail=100
```

### Health Checks

#### Service Health Endpoints
```bash
# Head servers
curl http://localhost:9669/health    # Head server 1
curl http://localhost:9670/health    # Head server 2

# Cluster servers
curl http://localhost:8080/health    # Cluster server 1
curl http://localhost:8081/health    # Cluster server 2
curl http://localhost:8082/health    # Cluster server 3

# Monitoring services
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets  # Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health      # Grafana health
```

#### ZooKeeper Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check ZooKeeper monitor status
docker-compose exec zk-head-monitor ps aux | grep zk_head_server_monitor

# Interactive health check
docker-compose exec zk-head-monitor /usr/local/bin/zk_head_server_monitor -i
# Then use: status, leader commands
```
