✅ Discovered head server: head_server_1 at 127.0.0.1:9669
✅ Discovered head server: head_server_2 at 127.0.0.1:9670
✅ Created ZNode: /distributed_file_grid/leader
✅ New leader elected: head_server_1
✅ Health report generated with leader information
```

### **6. Health Monitoring Test**
```bash
# Result: ✅ SUCCESS
# Comprehensive health report generated:

=== Head Server Health Report ===
Monitor ID: monitor_140960_19310208878502
Current Leader: head_server_1
Total Head Servers: 2
  Server: head_server_1 | Status: healthy | Address: 127.0.0.1:9669 | Leader: Yes | CPU: 25.5% | Memory: 60.2% | Connections: 10
  Server: head_server_2 | Status: healthy | Address: 127.0.0.1:9670 | Leader: No | CPU: 25.5% | Memory: 60.2% | Connections: 10
Healthy Servers: 2/2
```

## 🏗️ **ZooKeeper Architecture Verified**
